# Breast Cancer Detection with Deep Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Developed a deep learning model to classify histopathological images of breast tissue into **cancerous** and **non-cancerous** categories, with a focus on detecting **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)**.

---

## ðŸ“„ Summary
- Designed and implemented a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to automate breast cancer detection from histopathology images.
- Achieved **86% accuracy** on validation dataset with strong class-wise performance:  
  - Precision: **0.89** (non-cancerous)  
  - Precision: **0.77** (cancerous)  
- Applied **data augmentation, dropout, and batch normalization** to improve generalization and reduce overfitting.
- Built an **end-to-end pipeline** including preprocessing, training, evaluation, and feature visualization.

---

## ðŸ›  Key Responsibilities
- Collected and preprocessed **220K+ histopathology images** from Kaggle IDC dataset.
- Implemented **train-test split** and directory-structured dataset management for scalable training.
- Built a **multi-layer CNN architecture** using separable convolutions, pooling layers, batch normalization, and fully connected layers.
- Applied **image augmentation techniques** (rotation, zoom, shift, shear, flips) to enhance dataset diversity.
- Integrated **model checkpointing, early stopping, and learning rate reduction** for optimized training.
- Conducted **model evaluation** using confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy/loss plots.
- Implemented **feature map visualization** to interpret CNN filters and activation layers.
- Saved and deployed the trained model for real-time predictions on random test images.

## ðŸ“š Background
Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, and **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)** is the most common subtype.  
Accurate classification of breast cancer subtypes is a critical clinical task, and **automated deep learning methods** can significantly reduce diagnostic time and error.
